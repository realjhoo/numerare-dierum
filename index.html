      Today, 2021.02.24, is the 70th day of Duomelia in the Triennium of 2459,
      or more concisely, 2459-2-70. The time, in beats may be appended, thusly
      2459-2-70@040.98

        As you may have realized, I am interested in measuring time. This is
        what fueled my interest in Beat Time, which is essentially a form of
        decimal time such that the day is arbitrarily divided into 1,000 units,
        called beats. More about this can be read ***here***. If the measurement
        of time can be reformed in this way, then it stands to reason that dates
        could also be decimalized, giving us a system completely devoid of
        connections to Earth's natural cycles
      </p>
      <p>
        Measuring time with 'beats' results in the accumulation of days. Beat
        time is universal and only coincides with terrestrial time
        coincidentally. This accumulation of days I will term "Ad Numerare
        Dierum" (ND), literally, the count of days. It includes the fractional
        part of the day in Beat Time after the "@" sign. Luckily, this concept
        already existed in the form of the Julian Period, which is simply the
        count of days since 4713 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this standard, the current date 2459270, which, as I said,
        represents the count of days since 1 January 4713 BC. In order to make
        this number more "user friendly" and format it into chunks that we can
        remember, we divide the ND into Trienniums, Melias and Centums (yes,
        there is a Latin theme developing here). Each Triennium represents the
        span of about 2.7 solar years. The current Triennium is 2459.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Melia represents groups of 100 days. There are, naturally, 10 of these
        groups. Each Melia is named so that they can be used much like months,
        although they are more than three times longer. The Melias are:
      </p>
      <li>Nullamelia</li>
      <li>Unumelia</li>
      <li>Duomelia</li>
      <li>Triamelia</li>
      <li>Quattarmelia</li>
      <li>Quinquemelia</li>
      <li>Sexmelia</li>
      <li>Septmelia</li>
      <li>Octomelia</li>
      <li>Novemelia</li>
      <p>
        Currently, it is Duomelia, and it will remain so for another 29 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two rightmost digits represent the "Centum". Today's Centum is 70.
        The day after Centum 99 is Centum 00.
      </p>
      <p>
        The illogical and mismatched groupings of time that once tracked the
        seasons is fine for local use, and for its original purpose, tracking
        religious feasts and celebrations. But it will never make sense for time
        on Mars or Centauri Proxima to track the time with 12 months, each
        consisting of a random number of days making up a year that 365.25 days
        long.
